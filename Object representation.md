# Polygonal representation

Polygon is a representation of the surface. It is primitive which is closed in nature. It is formed using a collection of lines. It is also called as many-sided figure. The lines combined to form polygon are called sides or edges. The lines are obtained by combining two vertices.

如果两个面的法向量夹角差距很大，不合并两个面，如果差距很小，可以合并到一个面
